<h2 style="text-align: center;">BABYGENERATOR PRIVACY POLICY</h2> 
<p></p> 
<p>This privacy policy governs your use of the software application BabyGenrator for mobile devices that was created by DBAI. &nbsp;</p>
<h4>Welcome to BabyGenrator’s Privacy Policy!</h4>
<p>If you decide not to read this entire Privacy Policy, we want you to walk away with a few key points about BabyGenrator’s privacy practices:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Our application uses the newest technology of artificial intelligence to analyze two given faces and produce an image of your cute baby.</li>
  <li>Due to the limited processing resources available on mobile devices, we use a cloud server to process photographs.</li>
  <li>The App only uploads to the cloud the photographs that you specifically select for predicting. <br>Photographs are temporarily cached on the cloud servers during the predicting process.</li>
  <li>Photographs remain in the cloud for a limited period of 24-48 hours after you have last predicted the photograph, so that you can return to the image and make additional predicts if you so choose. <br>All your photos will be deleted for up to 48 hours.</li>
  <li>We do not use the photographs you provide when you use the App for any reason other than to provide you with the baby predicting functionality of the App.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you have any questions about our privacy practices, please email datnguyenvan844@gmail.com.</p>
